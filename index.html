    <h1>a tree is a perennial plant with an elongated stem, or trunk, 
        usually supporting branches and leaves. In some usages, the definition of a tree may be narrower,
         including only woody plants with secondary growth, 
         plants that are usable as lumber or plants above a specified height <a href="Main.html">Visit Website

<p>Trees usually reproduce using seeds. Flowers and fruit may be present, but some trees, such as conifers,
     instead have pollen cones and seed cones. <strong>Warning:</strong>
    Palms, bananas, and bamboos also produce seeds, but tree ferns produce spores instead.</p>
